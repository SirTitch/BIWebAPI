Web API Code Challenge

The Scenario
You are a freelance web developer. A client who runs an insurance brokerage asks you to make his customers’ policies available over the internet. They would like to start by being able to add, search and edit policies. As this is a prototype using dummy data the client does not currently require any access restrictions.

Requirements
Database
The client was able to provide a JSON file describing the policies. This can be found on page 2 (or in the attachment named Achme Broker.json). Use this to create a suitable relational database (MySQL or similar).

Server
You should write an API that will query the database and return a list of policies via a JSON response. The server can be written in any OOP language though PHP would be preferred.

Frontend
You should create a policy list web page that renders the policy data making use of a common JavaScript framework such as Vue, Angular or React (Vue preferred). The interface should include the ability to filter the data. Attention should be paid to making the overall design look polished.

Deliverables
A link to a public git repository (github or bitbucket) with all of your source code and database schema should be sent to matthew@brokerinsights.com and ian@brokerinsights.com 

It would be of great benefit if your build is deployed to Heroku, zeit or any other free hosting solution.

Please include a README that details how to use / run / interact with the solution.

This challenge will give us insight into the level to which you’re applying, so you may wish to demonstrate the expected qualities, which may include clean code, testing, design patterns, CI/CD.
